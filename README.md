# Trustworthy AR Conversation

[Trevor Flowers](https://trevor.smith.name/) is spinning up new project that has one goal with three parts:

- [Create good AR glasses](https://github.com/Transmutable/trustworthy-ar-conversation/wiki/Mission#good-ar-glasses)
- [That you want and need](https://github.com/Transmutable/trustworthy-ar-conversation/wiki/Mission#that-you-want-and-need)
- [That deserve your trust](https://github.com/Transmutable/trustworthy-ar-conversation/wiki/Mission#that-deserve-your-trust)

The plan is to use this repo's [Issues](https://github.com/Transmutable/trustworthy-ar-conversation/issues) and [Wiki](https://github.com/Transmutable/trustworthy-ar-conversation/wiki) to pull together initial ideas and collaborate. Once there is a non-profit legal structure that can own its own GitHub org we'll move this repo over there.

A good starting point is the [Mission](https://github.com/Transmutable/trustworthy-ar-conversation/wiki/Mission#that-deserve-your-trust) wiki page so head that way!
